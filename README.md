A comprehensive collection of distributed systems and high-performance computing implementations featuring advanced concurrency patterns, optimized matrix operations, and enterprise-grade networking solutions. This repository demonstrates mastery of parallel computing paradigms, thread safety mechanisms, and performance optimization techniques.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains two major assignments from a Distributed Systems course, each showcasing different aspects of high-performance and concurrent system design:

| Assignment | Focus Area | Technologies | Key Concepts |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Assignment 1** | High-Performance Matrix Operations | C++, Rust | Algorithm optimization, memory locality, parallelization |
| **Assignment 2** | Concurrent Chat Server System | Java | Thread management, network programming, synchronization |

## Key Features

### Assignment 1: Matrix Multiplication Optimization
- **Multi-Language Implementation**: C++ and Rust versions with performance comparisons
- **Algorithm Variants**: Simple, line-based, and block-based matrix multiplication approaches
- **Performance Optimization**: Compiler flags, memory access patterns, and cache locality improvements
- **Parallel Processing**: Optional parallelization for enhanced throughput
- **Benchmarking Framework**: Comprehensive testing with configurable iterations

### Assignment 2: Concurrent Chat Server
- **Advanced Concurrency Architecture**: Virtual thread-based client handling with sophisticated locking mechanisms
- **Multi-Layer Authentication System**: PBKDF2 password hashing with secure session token management
- **Thread-Safe Room Management**: Concurrent room creation/joining with race condition prevention
- **Comprehensive Connection Monitoring**: Heartbeat system with automatic stale connection cleanup
- **Enterprise Security**: Rate limiting, IP-based connection controls, and input sanitization
- **Message Reliability**: Acknowledgment tracking with timeout monitoring and automatic cleanup

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
Java 17+
g++ (C++17 support)
Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
```

## Assignment 1: High-Performance Matrix Multiplication

### Algorithm Implementations

The matrix multiplication assignment explores three optimization strategies:

| Algorithm | Approach | Performance Characteristics |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|
| **Simple** | Basic triple-nested loop | Baseline implementation |
| **Line-based** | Row-wise optimization with optional parallelization | Improved cache locality |
| **Block-based** | Cache-oblivious block multiplication | Optimal memory access patterns |

### Running C++ Implementation

```bash
cd assign1/cpp

# Simple matrix multiplication
./script.sh 1 <iterations>

# Line-based with parallelization option
./script.sh 2 <iterations> <p/n>

# Block-based with configurable block size
./script.sh 3 <iterations> <block_size>

# Run all algorithms
./script.sh 4 <iterations>
```



### Performance Optimization Features

- **Compiler Optimization**: O2 flag for C++, release mode for Rust
- **Memory Access Patterns**: Cache-friendly data traversal
- **Parallel Processing**: Optional multi-threading for line-based algorithm
- **Benchmarking**: Configurable iteration counts for statistical analysis

## Assignment 2: Concurrent Chat Server System

### Architecture Overview

The chat server implements enterprise-grade concurrency patterns:

| Component | Threading Model | Synchronization |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Client Authentication** | Virtual threads per client | Global ReadWriteLock + synchronized maps |
| **Room Operations** | Shared thread pool | Global ReadWriteLock for room state |
| **Message Processing** | Dedicated virtual threads | Message-specific locks + acknowledgment tracking |
| **Connection Monitoring** | Background heartbeat threads | Dedicated heartbeat locks + cleanup routines |


### Security Architecture
